# Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)

BERT is the state of the art Embedding algorithm in Natural Language Processing introduced by Google researchers in 2018. In short, embedding techniques aim to bring tokens (words or subwords in the sentences) into a numerical representation for feeding to Neural Networks for further processings. BERT reaches the state-of-the-art performance compared to all other embedding methods, such as GloVe by stanford, Fasttext by Facebook (Meta), Word2Vec by Google and the rest. For further info on other embedding techniques refer to another Github repository in my account, named [nlprocessing]().
